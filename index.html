<p>In the midst of a noisy university, George Dull lives in one of the quietest neighborhoods around: surrounded by more than 4,000 graves in the center of the Eugene Pioneer Cemetery.</p>

<p>“I get along great with my neighbors,” he says.</p>

<p>In his 24 years living in a trailer in the cemetery, Dull hasn’t had many unpleasant encounters with people passing through. Still, he doesn’t recommend walking through it at night. The interior of the property is deliberately left poorly lit to discourage people from doing so, says Kelly McIver, public information officer with UOPD.</p>

<p>There’s a perception that the cemetery is a hotbed of illegal activity, which is probably exaggerated by the nature of what the land is used for, McIver says. High rates of personal crimes—assaults and robberies—happen in areas with steady streams of people who could be targeted, and a steady stream of potential perpetrators.</p>

<p>“You just don’t get that with the cemetery,” he says.</p>

</div>

<p>Even so, the 16.5-acre lot remains in large part a mystery to the students who walk through it. For some, it’s a popular place to run, while others won’t go near it day or night. Some simply ignore it.</p>

<p>But to a group of men and women deeply rooted in the Eugene community, who work dozens of monthly hours beyond the sight of students, the cemetery is a source of responsibility to preserve and protect those buried there. For some of this aging group of volunteers, that includes, for some, their own ancestors.</p>

<p>One of those volunteers is Quentin Holmes, whose family ties to Eugene and the cemetery precede him by three generations, with the headstones to prove it. Holmes has been the president of the Eugene Pioneer Cemetery Association since 2012; Holmes’ great-grandfather Burt Lake is buried in the cemetery next to his first wife and sister. When Holmes was growing up, his mom frequently sent him to clean up the plot. Other board members with buried ancestors have similar stories from their childhoods.</p>

      </div>

</div>


<p>“Back then, that was just what people did,” Holmes says.</p>

<p>The cemetery association’sEPCA historian, Dorothy Brandner, is one of the few board members without family buried in the cemetery. B, but for years she has sifted through marriage licenses, death certificates, birth certificates and census reports on a mission to identify the estimated 4,200 people at rest the Pioneer Cemetery.</p>

<p>“It’s like a puzzle,” Brandner says about her work. “I like history and piecing the past together.”</p>

<p>The credit for her first getting involved goes to Bob Carmichael, who got his first, although unwilling, kiss in the cemetery in the fourth4th  grade. For several decades, he’s run a local dental practice, while managing a 300-tree Christmas tree farm and serving as the treasurer of the cemetery’s endowment fund. He first urged Brandner to get involved with the board at a dental appointment in 2003.</p>

      <p>The board includes several other members with long-standing links to the cemetery, but for Holmes, Brandner and Carmichael, it has maintained common ground between them as their connections to Eugene and each other have evolved  over the decades. They all went to South Eugene High School together, though they graduated in different years. Holmes left Oregon for several years; Brandner was a nurse at Sacred Heart. When Carmichael was a Kappa Sigma at the UO studying dentistry, he would go into the cemetery to seek solace. Today, he still visits frequently.</p>

<p>“I look at the gravesites like I did when I was a kid,” Carmichael says. “I feel good when I leave. I can leave there and know maybe I can make a difference, because I’m still alive.”</p>

<p>Their attachment to the cemetery has not been in vain; the board has played a crucial role in preserving the integrity of the graves and headstones since the cemetery association’sEPCA’s formation in 1930. The cemetery itself was established in 1873 under another organization; the association was formed by family members and plot owners.</p>

<p>The board also played a critical role in preserving the cemetery at a time when the fate of the bodies buried there, and the cemetery’s relationship with the UO, were not as secure as they have been for the past several decades. In the late 1960s, the university decided it wanted to expand onto the cemetery’s north end, which would have required about 1,100 occupied graves to be dug up and moved. </p>

<p>Members of the EPCA and its board fought the proposal, which had to be settled through the state legislature. UO tried to compromise: One memorable proposal made by a state representative suggested that the university  construct a building over the cemetery, raised above the ground on stilts (see photo below). An EPCA board member said at the time that the proposal “merits some consideration—but not much.”</p>

<p>The cemetery was eventually preserved because plot owners refused to surrender their land and  the EPCA discovered that a Medal of Honor winner, Louis Renninger, was buried there. Medal of Honor winners cannot be moved after they are buried, nor can the cemeteries in which they are buried be changed to some other purpose, according to the board. The university and cemetery have coexisted peacefully since then, aside from a few scuffles over lighting and fencing.</p>

    <p>In more recent years, the board decided to clear away much of the underbrush and low-hanging branches that used to obscure the view through the cemetery and made it a more welcoming environment for illicit activities.</p>

<p>The work involved with the cemetery is often physically demanding and requires long hours, which places a heavy burden on a board that consists of members mostly over the age of 70. Students sometimes get involved through community service or research projects, and the board is open to proposals for both. Holmes says that recruiting younger people to get involved is important when looking toward the future.</p>

<p>“You’ve located our Achilles Heel,” he says. “We have to take our old ways and recast them.” </p>

<p>Dull is younger than the board members, but he also feels the strain of maintaining the cemetery at his age. If asked how long he plans to stay, his response is blunt:</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Till I die, I guess,” he says.</p>

<p>In fact, he’ll be there longer. For his 20th work anniversary, the EPCA gave Dull his own plot towards the northeastern end of the cemetery, with a clear view of Mac Court.</p>

<p>“They got me for eternity,” Dull says, as his scuffed tennis shoes sink slightly into the damp green lawn.</p>
